# n-degrees-wikipedia

This program n_degrees() asks the user for a beginning Wikipedia url, an end Wikipedia url, and a target number of degrees in which to find the end url. It then attempts to find a path through the links on the beginning url to the end url in the specified number of degrees. If the search succeeds, a success message is returned, along with the number of degrees needed to complete the search and the search path from the beginning url to the ending url. If the search is unsuccessful, a failure message is returned.
